          Hi, we are Team Davinci Discovers. We created this
          website for our Software Design & Development 
          class at RPI. We wanted to create a tool for 
          art enthusiasts to find and learn more about a 
          artwork or artist they find interesting. We hope 
          you have enjoy learning and exploring new art you
          may not have known about before. Happy discovery!
        </p>
