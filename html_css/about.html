        <br>Hi, we are Team Davinci Discovers. We created this
        website for our Software Design & Development 
        class at RPI. We wanted to create a tool for 
        art enthusiasts to find and learn more about a 
        artwork or artist they find interesting. We hope 
        you have enjoy learning and exploring new art you
        may not have known about before. Happy discovery!
